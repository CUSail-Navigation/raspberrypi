Note: It's probably best to use a Python 3.7 virtual environment when working on this code. To make a virtual environment:

pip3 install virtualenv

virtualenv venv

To activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate

To deactivate: deactivate

The version of OpenCV used on the Raspberry Pi is 3.4.6.27. Try to install this version (pip3 install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.6.27). If you can't, then use the closest version (probably 3.4.8.29).
